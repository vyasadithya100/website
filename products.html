          <h3>Dark Chocolate</h3>
          <p>
            Dark chocolate is made with cocoa solids, cocoa butter,
            and sugar, and has a strong, rich flavor. It is often
            considered to be healthier than other types of chocolate
            because it contains more cocoa and less sugar. Dark
            chocolate can range in cocoa content from around 35% to
            over 70%.

          <h3>Milk Chocolate</h3>
          <p>
            Milk chocolate is made with cocoa solids, cocoa butter,
            milk, and sugar. It has a creamy, sweet flavor and is the
            most popular type of chocolate in the world. Milk
            chocolate typically contains around 10-20% cocoa and is
            often used in chocolate bars and other treats.

          <h3>White Chocolate</h3>
          <p>
            White chocolate is made with cocoa butter, milk, and
            sugar, but does not contain cocoa solids. It has a creamy,
            sweet flavor and is often used in desserts and
            confections. Because it does not contain cocoa solids,
            white chocolate is not technically considered to be
            chocolate, but it is still a popular treat among many
            chocolate lovers.
